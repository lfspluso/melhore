# MelhoreApp – Project Context

One-page context for developers and AI-assisted development.

## What the app does

**Melhore** is a routine-improvement Android app with:

- **Reminders:** One-time and recurring (daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, or custom days of week); optional tags and priority. Each reminder can have **checklist items** (sub-tasks) that can be added, removed, and checked off. Reminders have a **status** (ACTIVE, COMPLETED, CANCELLED) and never deactivate themselves; they notify every 30 minutes until manually completed or cancelled (Sprint 13). **Routine type (Sprint 12):** Reminders can be marked as "Rotina" (Routine) type, which can have any recurrence pattern. Custom recurrence allows selecting specific days of the week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and is available for both Routines and regular Melhores. **Rotina task setup (Sprint 12.2):** When a Rotina notification fires, clicking it navigates to a task setup screen where users can add daily tasks (Tarefas) as child reminders. Tasks have start times and checkup frequencies. Task reminders schedule initial notifications at start time and checkup notifications every X hours with "Done", "Snooze", and "Continue" actions. **Rotina current period restriction (Sprint 12.2.1):** Tasks can only be created for the current period based on the Rotina's recurrence type (daily = current day, weekly = current week, biweekly = current biweekly window, monthly = current month, custom = current week). The task setup screen shows "Tarefas para: [date range]" and restricts the date/time pickers to the period; validation prevents saving tasks outside the period. After saving tasks or skipping the day, the screen navigates back to the Melhore home page (reminders list) with back stack cleared. **Rotina notification prevention (Sprint 21):** Rotinas do not notify if tasks already exist for the current period; the notification is skipped and the Rotina advances to the next occurrence. **Task visibility (Sprint 21):** Task reminders created by Rotinas appear in the Tarefas list immediately after creation, even before their scheduled start time.
- **Reminder list:** **Tabs (Sprint 12.3):** Tarefas (includes task reminders created by Rotinas, excludes Rotinas) and Rotinas (routine reminders only); tab selection persisted. Filter by multiple tags, priority, optional date range (e.g. "Próximos 7 dias", "Este mês"), and status (show/hide completed - Sprint 13); sort by due date (default: closest first), priority, title, or creation date (newest/oldest). **UI improvements (Sprint 21):** Filter and sort options accessible via icons in TopAppBar (filter icon with badge indicator when filters are active, sort icon); clicking icons opens bottom sheets with filter/sort options. Sync status appears as overlay strip banner at top (doesn't push content down). List can be shown **grouped by tag** (sections with "Sem tag" for untagged) or as a **flat list**; the choice is persisted and restored. Completed reminders show low-contrast styling, "MELHORADO" tag, and delete button (Sprint 13). **Warning section for pending confirmation (Sprint 15.5):** A warning section appears above all other tasks on the **Tarefas** tab when there are reminders tagged as "PENDENTE CONFIRMAÇÃO" (ACTIVE, past due date, not snoozed or snooze expired, non-recurring), displaying title "PENDENTE CONFIRMAÇÃO" and subtitle "É importante não deixar Melhores sem estarem completos, agendados ou cancelados" with a list of pending reminders. **Hourly pending confirmation check (Sprint 21):** WorkManager periodic worker checks every hour for pending confirmation reminders and notifies the user if any are found. Last-used filter, sort, group-by view, and **selected tab** are **persisted** and restored when the app reopens.
- **Notifications:** Local notifications at reminder time (exact alarm; fire even when app was killed); snooze support (Sprint 3). **New snooze options (Sprint 14):** "Fazendo" (1-hour follow-up with completion check), "15 minutos", "1 hora", "Personalizar" (custom duration). **"Fazendo" special flow (Sprint 14):** When user taps "Fazendo", a follow-up notification appears in 1 hour asking "Você estava fazendo {task name}, você completou?" with actions "Sim" (mark complete), "+15 min", "+1 hora", "Personalizar". **30-minute recurring notifications (Sprint 13):** Reminders notify every 30 minutes until marked as COMPLETED or CANCELLED. **Snooze options settings (Sprint 15):** Users can customize which snooze options appear in reminder notifications via Settings screen. Available options: "5 minutos", "15 minutos", "30 minutos", "1 hora", "2 horas", "1 dia", "Personalizar". Maximum 3 options can be selected at once; preferences persist across app restarts.
- **Completion/Cancellation (Sprint 13-14):** Users can mark reminders as complete (with confirmation modal "Você tem certeza?" or via "Fazendo" follow-up "Sim" action - Sprint 14) or cancel them (from edit screen with confirmation). Completed reminders stop notifying and show "MELHORADO" tag; cancelled reminders show "CANCELADO" tag.
- **Organization:** Tags, priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Urgent).
- **Accounts & Sync:** Google Sign-In authentication; data syncs across devices via Firebase Firestore. Each user's reminders, tags, and checklist items are scoped to their account. **Local-only mode (Sprint 19.5):** Users can choose "Continuar sem entrar" on the login screen to use the app without signing in; data stays on the device only (no cloud sync); reminder list shows "Apenas neste aparelho".
- **Storage:** Local Room database + Firebase Firestore cloud sync when signed in. Data persists locally; when using local-only mode, data remains on device only.

See [SPRINTS.md](SPRINTS.md) for details.

## Conventions

- **Screens:** `ReminderListScreen`, `CategoryListScreen`, etc.
- **ViewModels:** `ReminderListViewModel`, `AddReminderViewModel`, etc.
- **State/events:** `ReminderListState`, `ReminderListEvent` (or one-shot events in ViewModel).
- New code: follow the layer (UI → Domain → Data) and place in the module/package that owns that concern.
